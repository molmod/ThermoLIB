ThermoLIB is a library developed at the `Center for Molecular Modeling <https://molmod.ugent.be/>`_ (CMM) for the application of Statistical Physics and/or Thermodynamics to molecular simulations. The library consists of two main sub modules:

*  **Thermodynamics** - Module for reading, constructing, transforming and manipulating free energy profiles

*  **Kinetics** - Module for computing the rate constant of a process/reaction using transition state theory (TST)
