In this user guide we will outline how to use the various features of ThermoLIB, ranging from constructing free energy profiles/surfaces to transforming/(de)projecting them, extracting thermodynamic properties as well as computing kinetic reaction rates. Some code blocks you see in this user guide will return in the various :ref:`tutorials <seclab_tut>` that are also provided.
